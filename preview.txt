Preview for Tuesday, March 30th:
For this preview, I have constructed the basic 'outline' of my website. I have the framework and basic linkage, as well as some example blocks of content that will be contained in the website. It is currently possible to naviage between the screens and I have put in sample images or placeholder images in most of the spots where they are needed. Beyond that, I also have amount of the basic content and the places where some further files will be linked latter on. 
Next Steps:
The main things I still need to do are fill out the content of the website and clean up all the css. At the moment I just have some very basic stuff that makes it easier to see what is going on in the code. For instance, I gave several boxes a default colored background so that I could see that they were there and I added some basic css to make the top bar horizonal instead of vertical, but without any of the final styles for the top bar. For content, I have the places where further content will be linked, though they currently don't link to anything. I also have some 'sample text' to fill out places that will have text and descriptions in the future. In places I know I will have images but am not yet sure which ones I also have put in a very basic default placeholder image that I will be removing and replacing with the actual content once I finalize what that will be. 
For workshoping, I plan to add some more basic functionality (at least create the pages where several of the blank links will link to, even if they will still not have much content) and clean up my css a little. For instance, some of the text is not properly centered and my top bar is hideous to look at. Furthermore, I plan to restyle many of my hyperlinks into something more like buttons using forms and submits to clean it up. I'm not a fan of the fomating of hyperlinks.

3 main pages, each with the same general design:
1 page for the home page, home page has several 'featured' links and images that go with those links.
1 page for projects, divided into types of projects (coding, art, audio, writing?) - maybe a sub page for each of these as well.
1 page for 'about', basically a bio page with a picture of myself and a short description

need background, maybe several variations of background - soothing neutral images?
images and files to populate projects page and home page (probably sourse from personal worK or dummy personal work)
possible use open sourse implementation of really pretty css buttons I have saved?

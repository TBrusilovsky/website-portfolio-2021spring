# Project 3: Website Portfolio

For my website portfolio, I have created a website to display some of my work. It has sections dedicated to my writing, coding, and other activities such as art and cooking. 


Firstly, each page on my website contains a very similar topbar, an ul with the class 'topbar'. This list contains a header, the name of the particular page or section of the website, and then several buttons that link to other pages. Additonal buttons can just be added by creating additonal li. 
Below this the content varies slightly, though is all styled very similarly. Individual 'items' are all put within div's with the class 'project box', which ensures that everything has relativly uniform styles. Than the project box's contain their own headings, a preview image, and a further link that shows the previewed content. These links can be download links for items such as txt files, links to other websites, or playable audiofiles. 
The website has three main pages and three subpages. The main pages are the home page, which displays some recent work, an about page, which has a little information about me, and a projects page, which links to my various work. From the projects page you can click the various links to go to my three other pages, which each display some of my work. I have a page for code, a page for writing, and a page for other work.

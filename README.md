# Project 3: Website Portfolio

As of this submission, my website is still relativly bare bones, though I have the basic styling and design choices I am planning to include squared away. Firstly, each page on my website contains a very similar topbar, an ul with the class 'topbar'. This list contains a header, the name of the particular page or section of the website, and then several buttons that link to other pages. Additonal buttons can just be added by creating additonal li. 
Below this the content varies slightly, though is all styled very similarly. Individual 'items' are all put within div's with the class 'project box', which ensures that everything has relativly uniform styles. Than the project box's contain their own headings, contents, and potentially further links.
At the moment, the website has three main pages, with outlines of what content they will posses. In several cases, the exact images and text are not present and are instead filled with placeholder text or images. Several spots, such as the 'home' page have vaguely filled out boxes, though further links are not yet functional.
